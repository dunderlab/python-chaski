    "The Chaski Certification Authority (CA) module provides essential functions for managing digital certificates within the Chaski distributed network framework. It plays a critical role in ensuring secure and encrypted communication between nodes in a distributed network environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented functionalities of the Chaski CA include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Certificate Generation**: The CA generates digital certificates for nodes, which can be used to establish secure connections. This involves creating a public-private key pair and signing the certificate with the CA's private key.\n",
    "- **Certificate Revocation**: If a certificate is compromised or needs to be invalidated, the CA can revoke it. The revoked certificates are maintained in a Certificate Revocation List (CRL).\n",
    "- **Certificate Validation**: Nodes can validate digital certificates issued by the CA to ensure they are authentic and have not been revoked.\n",
    "- **Secure Communication**: The CA facilitates the establishment of SSL/TLS contexts for secure communications between nodes using issued certificates.\n",

    "The `CertificateAuthority` class in the `chaski.utils.certificate_authority` module implements these features. This class is used by Chaski nodes to request certificates, validate peers, and manage secure communications:"
