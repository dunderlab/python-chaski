Test Subscriptions Module
=========================

This module contains the TestSubscriptions class designed to assert and validate
the connection functionalities of ChaskiNode instances based on their subscription topics.
The tests are structured to ensure that nodes with matching subscriptions establish
connections correctly and can communicate effectively.

Functions
---------
- _close_nodes(nodes) : Close all instances of ChaskiNode in the provided list.
- assertConnection(node1, node2, msg) : Assert that two ChaskiNode instances are connected.
- assertNoConnection(node1, node2, msg) : Assert that two ChaskiNode instances are not connected.
- test_single_subscription_no_disconnect() : Test single subscription connections between ChaskiNodes without disconnecting other nodes.
- test_single_subscription_with_disconnect() : Test single subscription connections between ChaskiNodes with node disconnection during pairing.

        Test single subscription connections between ChaskiNodes without disconnecting other nodes.

        This test method performs the following steps to ensure nodes with matching subscriptions
        connect correctly:

        1. Create nodes with designated subscriptions: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'].
        2. Initiate connections from each subsequent node to the first node.
        3. Trigger a discovery phase to find and pair peers based on subscriptions.
        4. Immediately disconnect nodes after they are paired.
        5. Validate if nodes are connected based on their subscription topics.
        6. Close all node instances upon completion.

        Assertions
        ----------
        AssertionError
