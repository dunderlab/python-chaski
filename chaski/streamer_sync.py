ChaskiStreamerSync: Synchronous Wrapper for ChaskiStreamer
=========================================================================

The `ChaskiStreamerSync` module provides a synchronous interface for the
asynchronous `ChaskiStreamer`. It enables users to stream messages and perform
operations in a threaded environment without managing event loops directly.

Key Functionalities
-------------------
- Provides synchronous access to the asynchronous streaming functionalities of `ChaskiStreamer`.
- Manages an event loop running in a background thread.
- Facilitates graceful shutdown and resource cleanup.

    ChaskiStreamerSync: Synchronous Wrapper for ChaskiStreamer.

    The ChaskiStreamerSync class provides a synchronous interface for the
    asynchronous ChaskiStreamer, allowing users to stream messages and manage
    operations in a threaded environment, without dealing directly with event loops.

    Attributes
    ----------
    loop : asyncio.AbstractEventLoop
        The event loop instance for managing asynchronous tasks.
    streamer : ChaskiStreamer
        The underlying ChaskiStreamer instance for message handling.
    thread : threading.Thread
        The thread that runs the event loop.

    Methods
    -------
    close() -> None:
        Stops the ChaskiStreamer gracefully and shuts down the event loop.
    __getattr__(attr: str) -> typing.Any:
        Retrieves an attribute from the ChaskiStreamer instance,
        allowing access to its methods and properties.

        This constructor sets up an asynchronous event loop running in a separate thread

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args : tuple
            Additional positional arguments to pass to the ChaskiStreamer initializer.
        **kwargs : dict
            Additional keyword arguments to configure the ChaskiStreamer instance.

        Notes
